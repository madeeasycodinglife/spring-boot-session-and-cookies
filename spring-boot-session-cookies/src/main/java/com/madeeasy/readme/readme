To inspect session IDs in real-time using your browser's developer tools:

#1) Start the Spring Boot application.

#2) Access the URL http://localhost:8080/set-cookie-session in your web browser. This sets the cookie,
session values, and displays the session ID.

#3) Open your browser's developer tools. You can typically do this by right-clicking on the page and selecting
"Inspect" or pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (depending on your browser).

#4) In the developer tools, go to the "Application" or "Storage" tab (the name may vary depending on the browser).

#5) In the "Cookies" section, you will see the cookies set by the application, including the session ID cookie (usually named JSESSIONID).

#6) You can inspect the session ID cookie's value, which will match the session ID displayed by the application.

This real-time inspection demonstrates how Spring Boot associates a session with a session ID, which is stored
as a cookie on the client-side.
